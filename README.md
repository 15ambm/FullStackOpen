# FullStackOpen

This is my repository of work completed for the free online course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), offered by the university of Helsinki.

All work was completed by me, Alex Mason, with direction and help from the course.

Certain apps required there own separate repositories, which can also be found on my GitHub. Namely, a [Phonebook](https://github.com/15ambm/PhonebookBackend) app and a [Notes](https://github.com/15ambm/NotesBackend) app.
